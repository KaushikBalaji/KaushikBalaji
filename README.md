# Hi üëã, I'm Kaushik
*M.Tech Student in System-on-Chip Design | VLSI Enthusiast | Open Source Developer*

üéì I‚Äôm currently pursuing my **M.Tech in System-on-Chip Design (SoCD)** at IIT Palakkad.  
üíª Passionate about **VLSI, Digital Design, Computer Architecture, Shell programming, and Semiconductor physics**.  
üå± Currently learning: Bash Scripting, Verilog, Vivado.  
üí¨ As a CSE major, stuck with choosing Digital design vs Analog design, so would like more thoughts on this.  
üî≠ Working on: Designing a RISC-V processor using python and making performance study on it. Also working on Design and synthesis of hardware components using verilog.
